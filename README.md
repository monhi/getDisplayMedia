# getDisplayMedia
This is a simple local repository to load a static page from public folder.

The contents of static page is from following page:

https://webrtc.github.io/samples/src/content/getusermedia/getdisplaymedia/

It is a simple page that calls getDisplayMedia function.

In a project I need to exactly know how to work with it.

Thus I make this repo.
